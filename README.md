# Run Away

A social running app for the web3 world.

## Roadmap
 - [] Track total time and distance for any given run
 - [] Store completed runs in `localStorage`
 - [] Display completed runs on in-app map
 - [] Allow storage of completed routes on IPFS
 - [] Allow sharing of routes with friends via Waku network

### Note

It doesn't do anything interesting yet.
